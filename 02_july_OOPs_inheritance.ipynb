    "1.Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used. \n",
    "Ans1.\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. The new class, known as the \"derived\" or \"child\" class, inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of the existing class, known as the \"base\" or \"parent\" class. Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes, where the derived class is a specialized version of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is used in object-oriented programming for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "d.Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of simple inheritance in Python is as follows:\n",

    "In Python, the \"protected\" access modifier is denoted by a single underscore (_) prefix before an attribute or method name.

    "\n",
    "Here are the key points about the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance, along with the differences from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access within the Class Hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.Public (no prefix): Attributes and methods without any prefix are accessible from anywhere, both within the class and outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.Protected (_ prefix): Attributes and methods with a single underscore prefix are considered protected, indicating that they should only be accessed within the class and its derived classes. They are not intended to be accessed from outside the class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "c.Private (__ double underscore prefix): Attributes and methods with a double underscore prefix are considered private, indicating that they should only be accessed within the class itself. They are not intended to be accessed or overridden by derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance and Derived Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public: Public attributes and methods are inherited by derived classes as they are. Derived classes can access and use them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected: Protected attributes and methods are also inherited by derived classes, and they can access and use them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private: Private attributes and methods are not inherited by derived classes. They are only accessible within the class in which they are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that Python does not enforce strict access control like some other languages. The access modifiers are more of a naming convention and provide a guideline for developers to indicate the intended usage and visibility of attributes and methods."
